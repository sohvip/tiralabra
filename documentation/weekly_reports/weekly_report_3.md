# Weekly Report 3
I improved my data structure and modified the raffle mechanic so that it actually uses the probability frequency
distribution to draw the next note. I structured my code better and moved methods to their own separate classes.
Unit testing also went a little bit forward but there are still classes that need testing. I am still having
trouble figuring out the best way to input the reference music, so that will be my main task for
next week. (At the moment reference.txt contains purely random notes so melodies that the generator creates
are really weird :D)

**Questions of the week:**
- If I input reference music as abc-notation files, do I just parse the notes out of it and ignore their lengths?
- Is the algorithm now working as intended or are there still some improvements that need to be made?

**Time Spent:** 9 hours
