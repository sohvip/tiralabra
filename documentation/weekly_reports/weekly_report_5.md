# Weekly Report 5
I improved the lilypond.ly file so that it now also creates a midi-file. I created a new file music_path.py which (hopefully) fixes the issue my peer reviewer had while trying to use the program. The issue was that the program didn't find the files located in the music-folder. I also did more testing. I still haven't figured out a way to input reference music efficiently. I ditched the idea of using abc-notation because i couldn't find any good reference music written into that form. So, I'm thinking that I'll just manually write a couple of good reference pieces that can be used.
  
**Question of the week:**  
- Does the program need more testing?

**Time Spent:** 5 hours
