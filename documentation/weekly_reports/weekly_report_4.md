# Weekly Report 4
I improved the algorithm so that it is now possible to generate melodies using any order Markov chain. I also introduced Lilypond to the project. So, now the app writes a lilypond file of the generated melody and that file can be translated to sheet music using the Lilypad software. I also did more unit testing and implemented automated tests and Codecov. I'm still finding it difficult to provide an efficient way to input reference music. That is something I need to work on more in the following week.

**Question of the week:**  
- Is the algorithm now working as intended or do I still need to modify it?

**Time Spent:** 6
