## Weekly Report 2

This week I created a raw version of my data structure (trie) and a really simple composing function. 
I also did some unit testing. I think that I am starting to get a hang of this project but I am yet to 
actually decide in which format I would like to input and store the data. Now I input the music as their 
corresponding letters and then convert them into numbers 1-12 but I am starting to think that this is not 
the right way to do it. Next week I will probably dive into the abc-notation and start utilizing it. That 
way I think I could also introduce notes of different lengths to my project because now every single note's 
length is considered as same.

**Questions of the week:**
- Is my data structure valid or should I modify it?
- When it comes to calculating the frequencies, is it enough to add duplicates of the same note to the list 
  so that when randomly picked, the note with the most candidates on the list has the biggest chance of being 
  chosen?

**Time Spent:** 6 hours
