### Topic
A music generator that composes melodies based on reference pieces that have been input to the system. The reference pieces must be given as strings of letters that represent different notes.

### Algorithms and Data Structures
The application uses a Markov algorithm chain to create new content. Input data is stored in a Trie. I chose these because they were recommended on the course page.

### Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of items in the chain. The same O(n) is also the space complexity.
