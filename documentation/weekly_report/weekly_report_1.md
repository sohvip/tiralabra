## Weekly Report 1

Most of my time went to choosing a topic for the project and then getting a brief understanding of the Markov chain and Trie data structure. I decided to make a music generator which I am excited about. I am a bit worried that it will be tricky and time-consuming to implement but I will try my best.

I am not sure how to start the project, so my question is: Is it best to begin by creating a trie where the reference data is stored, or is it more reasonable to start in another way.

**Time Spent:** 5 hours
